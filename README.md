Router re-boot with Raspberry Pi and Python.

My Westell DSL router locks up several times a day. Frontier won;t do anything except send me a new one. I now have 4 routers and all behave the same. If I pull the power plug for 10 seconds, the router reboots and I have intener access for a few more hours.

These Python scripts and approach are based on work by others:
